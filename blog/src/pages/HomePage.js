    <h1>Welcome to the blog!</h1>
    <p/>Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. It was the first taste of alcohol Buster had since he was nursing. It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face.

    <p/>No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! Perhaps an attic shall I seek. I'll sacrifice anything for my children. Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways.

    <p/>Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold. I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had. Pound is tic-tac-toe right? Who? i just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of ann.

    <p/>I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON. They don't allow you to have bees in here. What do you think about Sudden Valley? It sounds like a salad dressing, but for some reason I don't want to eat it.
